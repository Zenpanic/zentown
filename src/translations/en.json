They all have something to gain from having a website, because a website is much more than just a dematerialized catalogue, book or portfolio. It's a 24/7 showcase for your creations, products, ideas, services and values. It's a meeting place, and a hub for sharing information and knowledge. It's a tool to navigate the world. And above all, it's a living and changing thing, accessible by anyone, anywhere in the world. If you're trying to reach a large amount of people, in most cases it will also become the first impression you make on them. That's why it is important to get it done the right way, in respect of both your vision and the technical speficities of the web medium.",
